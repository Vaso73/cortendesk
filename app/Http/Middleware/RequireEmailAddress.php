 * Same shape as RequireTwoFactor: a user who cannot satisfy an enabled control
 * is sent to the screen where they can fix it, and only that screen and logout
 * are reachable until they do.
 *
 * Without this, an account with no address silently skipped verification
 * (LoginEmailVerification::required() returns false when there is nothing to
 * send to) — so the control was enabled and simply did not apply to whoever
 * happened to have a blank email. Now it applies to everyone or nobody.
 *
 * SSO sessions are exempt for the same reason they are exempt from 2FA: the
 * identity provider authenticated them, and a provisioned account's address is
 * the provider's to set, not the user's.
